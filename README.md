## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 **Passionate Full-Stack and React Native Developer:** I enjoy building unique backend projects in **Node.js**, and I specialize in **React**, **React Native**, **Node.js**, and database management (SQL/NoSQL). My projects often involve real-time applications, such as the **real-time chat app** I built with React Native and Firebase, where I optimized codebase efficiency, reduced build times by 30%, and enhanced app stability through testing and continuous integration.
  
- 📚 **Researcher in AI & ML:** I’m dedicated to advancing the field of AI and machine learning, particularly through my research work. My conference paper, **"Enhancing Sequential Recommendations with Bi-Directional Models: A Comparative Analysis,"** and **"Machine Learning Based Item Recommendation System for Surplus Item Sharing System"** have both been published on IEEE Xplore. 

- 🔍 **Research Interests:** My research projects focus on improving **medical image classification** using **Vision Transformers**, with an emphasis on implementing **Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms**. Additionally, I’m exploring the application of Vision Transformers in **IoT devices** for real-time image analysis, with the **pathMNIST dataset** for experimentation.

- 🧠 **Machine Learning Enthusiast:** I’ve designed innovative solutions using Bi-LSTM models for sequential recommendation systems, capturing evolving user preferences to deliver personalized recommendations with improved accuracy. I’m currently involved in exciting projects in machine learning for healthcare and am keen to tackle real-world challenges using predictive models, regression analysis, and Vision Transformers.
